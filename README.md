# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis Case Study

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study !  
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. This company offers bike share program which allows people to rent bikes to ride based on their need and convenience. The company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships of the bike share program. Using the historical bike trips data provided by the company, in this case study we will try to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From the insights we gain from the data and the trends we observe in the data visualizations, we will help the company design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members for company's future growth and success.

## About the company
In 2013, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.  
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.  
- Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as **casual** riders.
- Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic **members**.  

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, The director of marketing (Lily Moreno) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, she believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.  

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
